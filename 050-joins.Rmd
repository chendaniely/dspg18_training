```{r}

    1, "x1",

# many to one OR one to many
```{r}
(x <- tribble(
    ~key, ~val_x,
    1, "x1",
    2, "x2",
    3, "x3",
    1, "x4",
    1, "x5",
    1, "x6"
))

(y <- tribble(
    ~key, ~val_y,
    1, "y1",
    2, "y2",
    4, "y3"
))
```

```{r}
x %>%
    left_join(y, by = 'key')
```



# many to many

```{r}
(x <- tribble(
    ~key, ~val_x,
    1, "x1",
    2, "x2",
    3, "x3",
    1, "x4",
    1, "x5",
    1, "x6"
))

(y <- tribble(
    ~key, ~val_y,
    1, "y1",
    2, "y2",
    4, "y3",
    1, "y4",
    1, "y5"
))
```

a many to many join creates a cartesian product

```{r}
x %>%
    left_join(y, by = 'key')
```


The below code won't work, but it's to show you that you can join by multiple keys

```r
x %>%
    left_join(y, by = c('key', 'col2', 'col3'))
```

as well as do joins when columns do not share the same name

```r
x %>%
    left_join(y, by = c('key' = 'key2', 'col2' = 'other', 'col3'))
```
